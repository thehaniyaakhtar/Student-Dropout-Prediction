**Ensemble Modeling for Binary Classification**

---

## 🔍 **Problem Statement:**

The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify instances into one of two categories. The dataset presents a binary classification challenge with potentially overlapping feature spaces, requiring models that can generalize well and reduce variance in predictions.

---

## 🎯 **Objective:**

* To evaluate and compare the performance of individual classifiers.
* To enhance classification accuracy using ensemble techniques like **Voting Classifiers** (hard and soft voting).
* To explore the impact of hyperparameter tuning on model performance.

---

## 📦 **Dataset:**

* Contains labeled samples for binary classification.
* Includes a mix of numerical and/or categorical features (assumed preprocessed).

---

## 🛠️ **Methods Used:**

### 🔹 Individual Base Models:

* **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**
* **Logistic Regression (LR)**
* **AdaBoost Classifier (ABC)**
* **XGBoost Classifier (XBC)**

Each model captures different patterns:

* LR captures linear relationships.
* RFC and XBC handle non-linearities and feature interactions.
* ABC reduces bias through iterative correction.

### 🔹 Ensemble Learning:

* **VotingClassifier (Hard Voting):**
  Predicts the class with the majority vote.

* **VotingClassifier (Soft Voting):**
  Averages class probabilities from all models and predicts the most likely class.

### 🔹 Hyperparameter Tuning:

* Used `GridSearchCV` to optimize RFC (can be extended to others).
* Parameters tuned include:

  ```python
  {
    'bootstrap': [False, True],
    'max_depth': [5, 8, 10, 20],
    'max_features': [3, 4, 5, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 10, 12],
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300]
  }
  ```

## 📈 **Model Evaluation:**

* **Accuracy Score** used for performance comparison.
* VotingClassifier (both hard and soft) yielded an accuracy of **\~76.38%**, close to the best individual model.
* Indicates that ensemble models captured similar patterns as base models, with limited new information gained from voting.

---

## ✅ **Conclusion:**

* Ensemble models offer **stability and robustness**, even when individual models are only moderately accurate.
* **Soft voting** tends to perform better when model predictions are probabilistically calibrated.
* Further improvements can be achieved via:

  * Feature engineering
  * Better hyperparameter tuning
  * More advanced ensembles like **StackingClassifier** or **Bagging**
